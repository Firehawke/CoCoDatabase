The notes you see here predate my project to go back through old magazines. This material will eventually be merged in with the magazine research.

CoCo Newsroom / The Newspaper / The Newspaper Plus
--------------------------------------------------
From http://www.coco3.com/community/2008/05/thelda-game-creator-eric-a-wolf
Coco Newsroom, later upgraded and called ‘The Newspaper’, then ‘The Newspaper Plus’. Possibly with an OS-9 version too).
This is why the disks in CCA don't match TOSEC exactly; The disks in TOSEC are the older "CoCo Newsroom" release.
Two of the disks (fonts, graphics) were the same in both, but The Newspaper contains an additional art (fonts and graphics) disk and a different program disk.

There's a version 3.5 disk that's specifically tagged 'hi-res adapter', is that a modified build or official?
