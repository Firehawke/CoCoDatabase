# CoCoDatabase
TRS-80 Color Computer software library research database

In my desire to work on the TRS-80 Color Computer softlists in MAME, I've hit brick walls in terms of available information. Rather than keep my notes to myself, I'm going to make all of this publicly available. This material will eventually directly feed into MAME in a different form.
