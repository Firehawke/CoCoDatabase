[Page 26] PIPELINE rumor mill and small news tidbits:
	A couple of the more-established names in the business are contracted to Tandy for official software.
	Disk software is slow to market, but popping up more and more. Hardware orders still delayed.
	Tandy is apparently having unprecedented demand for the CoCo at Christmas, causing delays.
	Computerware has a 3D Drawing Board coming up. Also, two new games: MAZERACE and STORM. The latter has 135 levels.
	Another floppy drive from a third party: CER-COMP has a three-in-one drive system, review coming soon.
	ELECTRONIC SPECIALISTS has a "Super Isolator" surge protector for the CoCo with three outlets.
	Some of the first CoCo-specific books are now available from CONNECTION-80, along with a lowercase kit.
	CCWRITER from Transformation Technologies now supports the disk system. $5 upgrade for cassette owners.
	TransTech is also adding database, mailing list, and checkbook programs to their lineup, on tape/disk both.
	Rumor says Mark Data has another fast action game in the works that may be even better than BERSERK.
		(history notes Mark Data did a lot of good CoCo games, so.. this definitely ended up being true.)
	Has anyone received ANY order from Seebree's Computing? We'd like to know.
		(Sounds like a fly-by-night? I'll edit this if/when I find more details. Could be interesting.)
