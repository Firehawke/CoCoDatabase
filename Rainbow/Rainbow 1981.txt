	Previous projections had Spectaculator (spreadsheet) and Scripsit (word processor) releasing on December 15th. They have been
		delayed.
	Multipen Plotter: Will have CoCo support. Will be out in December or January, comes with disk software.
	Editor/Assembler cartridge: Availability has been pushed back to January or February because Tandy wants to add a debugger
	 	to the toolkit without loading it from tape.
